# Personal Website

This is my personal website built with Next.js and deployed on GitHub Pages.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Building for Production

To build the static site:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an `out` directory with the static files ready for deployment.

## Deployment

This site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. Push to the `main` branch to trigger a deployment.
